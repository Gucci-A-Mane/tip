          Dear Princess BB,<br><br>

          Happy Birthday BB!! You have turned 25 YEARS OLD today!!!
          You always said "You old, you old" but now you turned 25 too lolol<br><br>

          Maybe I don't tell you enough, but I am very proud of you.
          You are smart and responsible, always taking care of people around you. 
          You always be stressing, but you get it done at the end of the day and that is not what everyone can do.<br><br>

          I am also proud of you taking the next step for your career.
          I'm sure there were a lot of uncertainty, 
          "What would my parents think?", "I have committed too much?", "What do I even want to do?"
          I bet it took a lot of courage to change your career path.<br><br>

          Last year, a lot changed. We faced many tough times throuh our even further long distance relationship.
          Honestly, it has been really tough for both of us, but I think we are learning a lot about communicating and also more about each other.
          I think we are taking our steps in the right direction together as a couple. <br><br>

          Right now, I can't give you enough, but I promise I will get you the goyard bag or whatever you say you want.
          Thank you for everything. <br>
          Happy birthday bb, I always love you!!!<br>
          Your handsome bf that you don't love... <br>
          Amane
